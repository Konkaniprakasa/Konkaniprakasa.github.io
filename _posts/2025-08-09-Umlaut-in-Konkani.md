In Konkani, there are certain words whose plural forms are identical to their singular forms, differing only in vowel quality, with singular forms containing the **_'closed’_** vowel and plural forms containing the **_‘open’_** vowel. For example: **चोर** [t͡soɾ] ‘thief’ (m.sg) ↔ **चोर** [t͡sɔɾ] ‘thieves’ (m.pl) & **पोर** [poɾ] ‘boy’ (m.sg) ↔ **पोर** [pɔɾ] ‘boys’ (m.pl). How did this come about? A diachronic linguistic process called umlaut is to blame!

## What is Umlaut?
Umlaut is a type of assimilation, a linguistic process in which one sound changes to become more similar to a neighboring sound, either to ease pronunciation and/or to mark a semantic distinction. It often affects the nature of vowels in a language and is the reason English has forms like _foot–feet_ and _mouse–mice_ (we call this *'Germanic Umlaut'*).

## Diachronic Konkani Umlaut
The Konkani umlaut can be defined as follows: When a word contained either the _close-mid front_ [e] or _close-mid back_ [o]  followed by the _close back_ [u] (or the _close front_ [i]) in the next syllable, the preceding vowels remained unchanged. When the same vowels were followed by the _mid central_ [ə], they were lowered (or opened) to _open-mid_ [ɛ] and [ɔ] respectively. 

[This could indicate that the Konkani **_'schwa'_** is realized closer to the _open-mid vowel_ [ɜ].]

Once the umlaut process was established and vowel qualities shifted, the distinction between close-mid & open-mid vowels persisted regardless of whether [u] or [ə] were retained or dropped.

Let us look at some examples to understand how this happened-

> &nbsp; 'Thief' (m.sg) <br>
> &nbsp; **चोरः → चोरो → चोरु → चोरु → चोर​** <br>
> &nbsp; ćōraḣ → ćōrō → coru → coru [t͡soɾu] → cor [t͡soɾ]
>
> &nbsp; 'Thief' (m.pl) <br>
> &nbsp; **चोराः → चोरा → चोर → चोर → चोर​** <br>
> &nbsp; ćōrāḣ → ćōrā → cora → córa [t͡sɔɾə] → cór [t͡sɔɾ]
>
> **[Note how the final vowels dropped, yet the vowel changes caused by umlaut persist.]**

[Stages are in the following order- **_Sanskrit (OIA) → Prakrit (Early MIA) → Apabhramsha (Late MIA) → Old-Konkani (Early NIA) → Konkani (NIA)_**]

Some other illustrative examples-

> &nbsp; 'husband' (m.sg) <br>
> &nbsp; **गोहः → गोहो → <sup>+</sup>घोउ → घोवु → घोव​​** <br>
> &nbsp; gōhaḣ → gōhō → <sup>+</sup>gʰou → gʰowu [gʱoʋu] → gʰow [gʱoʋ]
>
> &nbsp; 'husbands' (m.pl) <br>
> &nbsp; **गोहाः → गोहा → <sup>+</sup>घोअ → घोव → घोव​​** <br>
> &nbsp; gōhāḣ → gōhā → <sup>+</sup>gʰoa → gʰowa [gʱɔʋə] → gʰów [gʱɔʋ]


> &nbsp; 'brother-in-law' (m.sg) <br>
> &nbsp; **देवरः → देवरो → देअरु → देरु ​→ देर​** <br>
> &nbsp; dēvaraḣ → dēvarō → dearu → deru [d̻eɾu] → der [d̻eɾ]
>
> &nbsp; 'brothers-in-law' (m.pl) <br>
> &nbsp; **देवराः → देवरा → देअर → देर ​→ देर​** <br>
> &nbsp; dēvarāḣ → dēvarā → deara → déra [d̻ɛɾə] → dér [d̻ɛɾ] 

> &nbsp; 'hair' (m.sg) <br>
> &nbsp; **केशः → केसो → केसु → केंसु → केंस​** <br>
> &nbsp; kēśaḣ → kēsō → kesu → kẽsu [kẽsu] → kẽs [kẽs]
>
> &nbsp; 'hair' (m.pl) <br>
> &nbsp; **केशाः → केसा → केस → केंस → केंस​​** <br>
> &nbsp; kēśāḣ → kēśā → kesa → kẽ́sa [kɛ̃sə] → kẽ́s [kɛ̃s]

> &nbsp; 'boy' (m.sg) <br>
> &nbsp; **<sup>+</sup>पोतरः → पोअरो → <sup>+</sup>पोरु →  पोरु → पोर​** <br>
> &nbsp; <sup>+</sup>pōtaraḣ → pōarō → <sup>+</sup>poru → poru [poɾu] → por [poɾ]
>
> &nbsp; 'boys' (m.pl) <br>
> &nbsp; **<sup>+</sup>पोतराः → पोअरा → <sup>+</sup>पोर​ → पोर​ → पोर​​** <br>
> &nbsp; <sup>+</sup>pōtarāḣ → pōarā → <sup>+</sup>pora → póra [pɔɾə] → pór [pɔɾ]
>
> _(Note- This word can be both masculine and neuter in Konkani)_

There are two special cases of this umlaut that create a semantic distinction (beyond simple pluralization). Interestingly, both examples represent fruit-tree pairs.

> &nbsp; 'jujube fruit' (n.sg) [_Ziziphus jujuba_] <br>
> &nbsp; **बदरम्‌ → बअरं → <sup>+</sup>बोर → बोर → बोर​** <br>
> &nbsp; bádaram → baaraṁ → <sup>+</sup>bora → bóra [bɔɾə] → bór [bɔɾ] <br>

> &nbsp; 'jujube tree' (f.sg) <br>
> &nbsp; **बदरी‌ → <sup>+</sup>बअरी → <sup>+</sup>बोरि → बोरि → बोर​** <br>
> &nbsp; badarī → baarī → <sup>+</sup>bori → bori [boɾi] → bor [boɾ] <br>

The next example is particularly intriguing, as it demonstrates the extension of this umlaut system even to two loanwords from Portuguese.

> &nbsp; 'pear fruit', 'guava fruit' (n.sg) [_Pyrus communis, Psidium guajava_] <br>
> &nbsp; **<ins>Portuguese</ins> pera /peɾɐ/ → <sup>+</sup>पेर​ péra [pɛɾə] → पेर​ pér [pɛɾ]** <br>
>
> &nbsp; 'pear tree', 'guava tree' (f.sg) <br>
> &nbsp; **<ins>Portuguese</ins> pereira /peɾɐjɾɐ ~ pɨɾɐjɾɐ/ → <sup>+</sup>पेरि peri [peɾi] → पेर per [peɾ]** <br>
