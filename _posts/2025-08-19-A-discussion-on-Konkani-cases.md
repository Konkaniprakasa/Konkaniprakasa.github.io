As with most other New Indo-Aryan languages, the two most important 'cases' in Konkani are the **direct case** (alternatively known as the 'nominative' case) and the **oblique case** (known in Konkani grammars as the सामान्य रूप​ sāmānya rūpa 'the general form').

A noun in the **direct case** often functions either as the subject or as the inanimate object in a sentence. Consider these two examples-

&nbsp; **राम घरांत आसा** <br>
&nbsp; rām gʰarānt āsā <br>
&nbsp; Ram.MASC.SG-NOM home.NEUT.SG-LOC is-3sg.PERF <br>
&nbsp; "Ram is at home."

&nbsp; **वानरान फातर उडयलो** <br>
&nbsp; vānarān pʰātar uḍaylo <br>
&nbsp; monkey.MASC.SG-ERG stone.MASC.SG-NOM is-MASC.3sg.PERF <br>
&nbsp; "The monkey threw the stone."

A noun in the **oblique case** functions as the noun-stem to which case endings are suffixed (the case endings can be dropped if the context is clear enough and is often dropped in fast speech). This oblique case also functions as the vocative case.
