In Konkani, there are certain words whose plural forms are identical to their singular forms, differing only in vowel quality (with singular forms containing the **_'closed’_** vowel and plural forms containing the **_‘open’_** vowel). For example: **चोर** [t͡soɾ] ‘thief’ (m.sg) ↔ **चोर** [t͡sɔɾ] ‘thieves’ (m.pl) & **पोर** [poɾ] ‘child’ (n.sg) ↔ **पोर** [pɔɾ] ‘children’ (n.pl). How did this come about? A diachronic linguistic process called umlaut is to blame!

## What is Umlaut?
Umlaut is a type of assimilation, a linguistic process in which one sound changes to become more similar to a neighboring sound, either to ease pronunciation and/or to mark a semantic distinction. It often affects the nature of vowels in a language and is the reason English has forms like **foot–feet** and **mouse–mice** (we call this *Germanic Umlaut*).

## Diachronic Konkani Umlaut
The diachronic Konkani umlaut can be defined as follows- When a word contained either the **close-mid front** [e] or **close-mid back** [o]  followed by the **close back** [u] in the next syllable, the preceding vowels remained unchanged. When the same vowels were followed by the **mid central** [ə], they were lowered (or opened) to **open-mid** [ɛ] and [ɔ] respectively. 

[This could indicate that the Konkani **_'schwa'_** is realized closer to the **open-mid vowel** [ɜ].]

Once the umlaut process was established and vowel qualities shifted, the distinction between close-mid and open-mid vowels persisted regardless of whether [u] or [ə] was retained or lost.
