In Konkani, there are certain words whose plural forms are identical to their singular forms, differing only in vowel quality (with singular forms containing the **_'closed’_** vowel and plural forms containing the **_‘open’_** vowel). For example: **चोर** [t͡soɾ] ‘thief’ (m.sg) ↔ **चोर** [t͡sɔɾ] ‘thieves’ (m.pl) & **पोर** [poɾ] ‘child’ (n.sg) ↔ **पोर** [pɔɾ] ‘children’ (n.pl). How did this come about? A diachronic linguistic process called umlaut is to blame!

## What is Umlaut?
Umlaut is a type of assimilation, a linguistic process in which one sound changes to become more similar to a neighboring sound, either to ease pronunciation and/or to mark a semantic distinction. It often affects the nature of vowels in a language and is the reason English has forms like _foot–feet_ and _mouse–mice_ (we call this *Germanic Umlaut*).

## Diachronic Konkani Umlaut
The Konkani umlaut can be defined as follows: When a word contained either the _close-mid front_ [e] or _close-mid back_ [o]  followed by the _close back_ [u] in the next syllable, the preceding vowels remained unchanged. When the same vowels were followed by the _mid central_ [ə], they were lowered (or opened) to _open-mid_ [ɛ] and [ɔ] respectively. 

[This could indicate that the Konkani **_'schwa'_** is realized closer to the _open-mid vowel_ [ɜ].]

Once the umlaut process was established and vowel qualities shifted, the distinction between close-mid & open-mid vowels persisted regardless of whether [u] or [ə] were retained or lost.

Let us look at some examples to understand how this happened-

'Thief' (m.sg) <br>
**चोरः → चोरो → चोरु → चोरु → चोर​** <br>
ćōraḣ → ćōrō → coru → coru [t͡soɾu] → cor [t͡soɾ]

'Thief' (m.pl) <br>
**चोराः → चोरा → चोर → चोर → चोर​** <br>
ćōrāḣ → ćōrā → cora → córa [t͡sɔɾə] → cór [t͡sɔɾ]

[Note how the final vowels were dropped, yet the vowel changes caused by umlaut persist.]

(Stages are shown as follows- **_Sanskrit → Prakrit → Apabhramsha → Old-Konkani → Konkani_**)
