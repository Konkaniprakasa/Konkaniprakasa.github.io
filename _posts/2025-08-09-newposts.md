There are certain Konkani words whose plural forms are identical to their singular forms, differing only in the quality of the vowel. Some examples- **चोर**​ [ʦoɾ] 'thief' (m.sg), **चोर​** [ʦɔɾ] 'thieves'(m.pl), **पोर**​ [poɾ] 'child' (n.sg), **पोर** [pɔɾ] 'children' (n.pl) etc. How did this happen?
