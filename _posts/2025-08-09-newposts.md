In Konkani, there are certain words whose plural forms are identical to their singular forms, differing only in vowel quality (with singular forms containing the **_'closed’_** vowel and plural forms containing the **_‘open’_** vowel). For example: **चोर** [t͡soɾ] ‘thief’ (m.sg) ↔ **चोर** [t͡sɔɾ] ‘thieves’ (m.pl) & **पोर** [poɾ] ‘child’ (n.sg) ↔ **पोर** [pɔɾ] ‘children’ (n.pl). How did this come about? A diachronic linguistic process called umlaut is to blame!

## What is Umlaut?
Umlaut is a type of assimilation, a linguistic process in which one sound changes to become more similar to a neighboring sound, either to ease pronunciation or to mark a semantic distinction. t often affects vowel quality in a language and is the reason English has forms like foot–feet and mouse–mice.
