In general, a verb is said to be intransitive (or अकर्मक​ akarmaka in the Indic grammatical tradition) when it does not require a direct object (कर्म karma) to express a complete action. On the other hand, a verb is said to be transitive (or सकर्मक​ sakarmaka) when it requires a direct object to express a complete action.
