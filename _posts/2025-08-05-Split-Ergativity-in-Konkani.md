## Transitivity

In general, a verb is said to be _intransitive_ (or अकर्मक​ akarmaka in the **_Indic grammatical tradition_**) when it does not require a direct object (कर्म karma) to express a complete action. On the other hand, a verb is said to be _transitive_ (or सकर्मक​ sakarmaka) when it requires a direct object to express a complete action.

## What is Split Ergativity?
Split ergativity is a phenomenon in some languages where _ergative-absolutive alignment_ is used in certain contexts, while _nominative-accusative alignment_ is used in others.

Konkani shows split-ergativity i.e., it shows both nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive alignments.  In the ergative-absolutive alignment, the subject of a transitive verb [_in perfective and preterite (past) environments_] takes the ergative marking [_which is identical to the instrumental case for nominals and a derivative of the instrumental case for pronominals_] rather than the nominative-accusative marking  in the case of subject of instransitive verbs [and other environments of transitive verbs]. This alignment results in the verb then agreeing with the object instead of the subject in terms of gender and number.

Taking different environments of the transitive verb खावंक kʰāuṅk​ 'to eat' as an example-

<ins> **Non-perfect environments:** </ins>

&nbsp; **भुरगो आंबो खाता** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgo	āmbo	kʰātā <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG mango.MASC.SG eat-SG.PRES <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy eats mango.' <br>
&nbsp; (_The simple present tense doesn't inflect for gender in Konkani_)

&nbsp; **भुरगो दाळ खातालो** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgo	dāḷ	kʰātālo <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG lentil.FEM.SG eat-MASC.SG.IMPRF <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy used to eat lentil.'

&nbsp; **भुरगो पोळो खातलो** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgo poḷo kʰātalo <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG pancake.MASC.SG eat-MASC.SG.FUT1 <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy will eat a pancake.'

&nbsp; **भुरगो लाडू खाय​त** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgo lāḍu kʰāyt <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG laddoo.MASC.SG eat-SG.FUT2 <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy might  eat a laddo.' <br>
&nbsp; (_The second future tense also called indefinite future, doesn't inflect for gender in Konkani_)<br>

As seen in the examples above, **_the verb agrees with the subject in terms of gender and number_** and the subject is in the nominative case. The direct objects here are left unmarked (usually accusative) because they are inanimate, more on that later.

<ins> **Perfect or Preterite (Past) Environments:** </ins>

&nbsp; **भुरग्यान कणंग खालें** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgyān kaṇaṅg kʰālẽ <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG-ERG sweet potato.NEUT.SG eat-NEUT.SG.PST <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy ate a sweet potato.'

&nbsp; **भुरग्यान खिचडी खाल्या** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgyān kʰicaḍi kʰālyā <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG-ERG porridge.FEM.SG eat-FEM.SG.PRF <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy has eaten the porridge.'

&nbsp; **भुरग्यान अळमीं खाल्लीं** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgyān aḷmĩ kʰāllĩ <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG-ERG mushrooms.NEUT.PL eat-NEUT.PL.PLPRF <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy had eaten mushrooms.' <br>

As seen in these examples, **_the verb agrees with the direct object in terms of gender and number_** and the subject is in the ergative (instrumental) case. 

This split with regards to ergativity, however, does not occur with intransitive verbs, where the subject consistently appears in the nominative case regardless of tense or aspect and the verb always agrees with the subject in terms of gender and number.

<ins> **Animacy and Inanimacy** </ins>

* Direct objects that are animate (in the simplest of terms, living entities) are often marked with the accusative-

  &nbsp; **चलयेन सुण्याक मारलो** <br>
  &nbsp; calyen	suṇyāk	mārlo <br>
  &nbsp; girl.FEM.SG-ERG	dog.MASC.SG-ACC	hit-MASC.SG.PST <br>
  &nbsp; 'The girl hit the dog.' <br>

  &nbsp; **बापायन धुवांक आपयल्यो** <br>
  &nbsp; bāpāyn	dʰuvā̃ṅk	āpaylyo <br>
  &nbsp; father.MASC.SG-ERG daughter.FEM.PL. call-FEM.PL.PST <br>
  &nbsp; 'The father called the daughters.' <br>

  &nbsp; **शींव चितळाक खाता** <br>
  &nbsp; śī̃v citaḷāk kʰātā <br>
  &nbsp; lion.MASC.SG deer.MASC.SG-ACC eat-SG.PRES <br>
  &nbsp; 'The lion eats the deer.' <br>

* Direct objects that are inanimate (in the simplest of terms, non-living entities) are left unmarked-

  &nbsp; **अस्तुऱ्येन फातर उडयलो** <br>
  &nbsp; asturyen	pʰātar uḍaylo <br>
  &nbsp; woman.FEM.SG	stone.MASC.SG	throw-MASC.SG.PST <br>
  &nbsp; 'The woman threw the stone.' <br>

  &nbsp; **पुतान घर पळयिल्लें** <br>
  &nbsp; putān gʰar paḷayillẽ <br>
  &nbsp; son.MASC.SG	house.NEUT.SG	see-NEUT.SG.PLPRF <br>
  &nbsp; ‘The son had seen the house.’ <br>

  &nbsp; **धूव टिव्ही घेता** <br>
  &nbsp; dʰūv ṭivʰi gʰetā <br>
  &nbsp; daughter.FEM.SG television.MASC.SG	buy-SG.PRES <br>
  &nbsp; ‘The daughter buys a TV.’ <br>


## Marking Ergativity in Pronominals

When pronominals function as the subject of a sentence, ergativity is marked using a so-called 'ergative' case (
