## Transitivity

In general, a verb is said to be _intransitive_ (or अकर्मक​ akarmaka in the **_Indic grammatical tradition_**) when it does not require a direct object (कर्म karma) to express a complete action. On the other hand, a verb is said to be _transitive_ (or सकर्मक​ sakarmaka) when it requires a direct object to express a complete action.

## What is Split-ergativity?
Split ergativity is a phenomenon in some languages where _ergative-absolutive alignment_ is used in certain contexts, while _nominative-accusative alignment_ is used in others.

Konkani shows split-ergativity i.e., it shows both nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive alignments.  In the ergative-absolutive alignment, the subject of a transitive verb [_in perfective and preterite (past) environments_] takes the ergative marking [_which is identical to the instrumental case for nominals and a derivative of the instrumental case for pronominals_] rather than the nominative-accusative marking  in the case of subject of instransitive verbs [and other environments of transitive verbs]. This alignment results in the verb then agreeing with the object instead of the subject in terms of gender and number.

Taking different environments of the transitive verb खावंक kʰāuṅk​ 'to eat' as an example-

<ins> **Non-perfect environments:** </ins>

&nbsp; **भुरगो	आंबो	खाता** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgo	āmbo	kʰātā <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG	 mango.MASC.SG	 eat-SG.PRS <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy eats mango.' <br>
&nbsp; (_The simple present tense doesn't inflect for gender in Konkani_)

&nbsp; **भुरगो	दाळ	खातालो** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgo	dāḷ	kʰātālo <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG	lentil.FEM.SG	eat-MASC.SG.IMPRF <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy used to eat lentil.'

&nbsp; **भुरगो	पोळो	खातलो** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgo	poḷo	kʰātalo <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG	pancake.MASC.SG	eat-MASC.SG.FUT1 <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy will eat a pancake.'

&nbsp; **भुरगो	लाडू	खाय​त** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgo	lāḍu	kʰāit <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG	laddoo.MASC.SG	eat-SG.FUT2 <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy might  eat a laddo.' <br>
&nbsp; (_The second future tense also called indefinite future, doesn't inflect for gender in Konkani_)<br>

As seen in the examples above, **_the verb agrees with the subject in terms of gender and number_** and the subject is in the nominative case. The direct objects here are left unmarked (usually accusative) because they are inanimate, more on that later.

<ins> **Perfect or Preterite (Past) Environments:** </ins>

&nbsp; **भुरग्यान	कणंग खालें** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgyān	kaṇaṅg	kʰālẽ <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG-ERG	sweet potato.NEUT.SG	eat-NEUT.SG.PST <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy ate a sweet potato.'

&nbsp; **भुरग्यान खिचडी खाल्या** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgyān kʰicaḍi kʰālyā <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG-ERG porridge.FEM.SG eat-FEM.SG.PRF <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy has eaten the porridge.'

&nbsp; **भुरग्यान अळमीं खाल्लीं** <br>
&nbsp; bʰurgyān aḷmĩ kʰāllĩ <br>
&nbsp; boy.MASC.SG-ERG mushrooms.NEUT.PL eat-NEUT.PL.PLPRF <br>
&nbsp; 'The boy had eaten mushrooms.' <br>

As seen in the above examples, **_the verb agrees with the direct object in terms of gender and number_** and the subject is in the ergative case.
