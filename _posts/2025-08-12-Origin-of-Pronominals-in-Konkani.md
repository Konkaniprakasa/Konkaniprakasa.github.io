I recently wrote a **"mega thread"** (one of the longest Twitter/X threads I have ever written single-handedly) on the origin of personal pronouns in Konkani. This post is going to be an expanded version wherein I will go into the details of the origin of not only personal pronominals but also others such as interrogative pronominals.

## Origin of personal pronominals in Konkani

Starting with 1sɢ = hā̃v हांव /ˈɦä̃ʋ/ “I” derives from Sanskrit 1ɴᴏᴍ.sɢ ahakam अहकम् (the general form being ahám अ॒हम्) via Prakrit ahaaṁ अहअं via Apabhramsha haüṁ हउं  ( cf. Gujarati hũ હું, Braj hãũ हौं , Sindhi a̅ū̃ آئُون आऊँ ).
