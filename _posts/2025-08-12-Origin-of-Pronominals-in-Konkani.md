Title: On the Origin of Pronominals in Konkani
layout: post
---

I recently wrote a **"mega thread"** (one of the longest Twitter/X threads I have ever written single-handedly) on the origin of personal pronouns in Konkani. This post is going to be an expanded version wherein I will go into the details of the origin of not only personal pronominals but also others such as interrogative pronominals.

## Origin of Konkani personal pronominals 

{ <sup>!</sup> = reconstructed or unattested }

Starting with 1sɢ = **hā̃v** हांव /ˈɦä̃ʋ/ “I”, it derives from Sanskrit 1ɴᴏᴍ.sɢ ahakam अहकम् (the general form being ahám अ॒हम्) via Prakrit ahaaṁ अहअं via Apabhramsha haüṁ हउं  [cf. Gujarati hũ હું, Braj hãũ हौं , Sindhi āū̃ آئُون आऊँ]. The 1ᴘʟ = **āmĩ** आमीं /ˈämĩ(ː)/ “we” derives from Sanskrit  ɪɴsᴛ.ᴘʟ  asmā́bʰiḣ अ॒स्माभिः॑ via Prakrit amʰēhiṁ अम्हेहिं via Apabhramsha amʰeiṁ अम्हेइं (attested Southern form is amʰaiṁ अम्हइं)[cf. Marathi āmʰi आम्ही, Gujarati ame અમે, Assamese āmi আমি, Hindi ham हम​].

The 2sɢ = **tũ** तूं /ˈt̻ũ(ː)/ “thou”, derives from Sanskrit 2ɴᴏᴍ.sɢ tᵤvám त्व॒म् via Prakrit tuhaṁ तुहं which continued in Apabhramsha as tuhaṁ or tuvaṁ तुहं/तुवं [cf. Marathi tu तू, Hindi tū तू, Punjabi tū̃ ਤੂੰ]. Interestingly some varieties of Konkani have this pronominal as tũva तुंव [ˈt̻ũʋə ~ ˈt̻ũʋə̃ ~ ˈt̻ũə̃] which is perhaps a conservatism. The 2ᴘʟ = **tumĩ** तुमीं /ˈt̻umĩ(ː)/ “you” derives from Sanskrit ɪɴsᴛ.ᴘʟ <sup>!</sup>tuṣmā́bʰiḣ <sup>!</sup>तु॒ष्माभिः॑ (the general form being yuṣmā́bʰiḣ यु॒ष्माभिः॑) via Prakrit tumʰēhiṁ तुम्हेहिं via Apabhramsha tumʰeiṁ तुम्हेइं (attested southern form is tumʰaiṁ तुम्हइं)[cf. tumʰi तुम्ही, Old Gujarati tumʰe તુમ્હે, Assamese tumi তুমি, Hindi tum तुम​]. The [t] here is in analogy the singular and is a pretty common thing throughout middle Indo-Aryan.

It is noteworthy that the ***first and second person pronominals in either Konkani or Sanskrit/Prakrit do not explicitly indicate gender***. In Konkani, they are grammatically  treated to be neuter because their origins are typical to neuter declensional bases. This fact, changes with the third person pronoun wherein gender is explicitly indicated and of which Konkani (like Sanskrit and Prakrit) has three.

The 3sɢ.ᴍ-ᴘʀᴏx = ho हो /ˈɦɔ/ “he” probably derives from Sanskrit ɴᴏᴍ.sɢ.ᴍ-ᴘʀᴏx <sup>!</sup>ēṣakaḣ <sup>!</sup>एषकः which would have given Prakrit <sup>!</sup>ēsagō <sup>!</sup>एसगो (we do find ēṣaḣ becoming ēsō in Prakrit), which we see in Apabhramsha as ehau एहौ (and ehu एहु), [ehau → <sup>!</sup>hau → ho]. The 3sɢ.ғ-ᴘʀᴏx = hi ही /ˈɦi(ː)/ “she” probably derives from Sanskrit ɴᴏᴍ.sɢ. ғ-ᴘʀᴏx <sup>!</sup>ēṣikā <sup>!</sup>एषिका  (the -ikā thematic added to an ēṣ- stem) which would give Prakrit <sup>!</sup>ēsigā <sup>!</sup>ऐसिगा or <sup>!</sup>ēsiā <sup>!</sup>ऐसिआ, which then would have become <sup>!</sup>ehia <sup>!</sup>एहिअ in Apabhramsha, [<sup>!</sup>ehia → <sup>!</sup>hia → hi]. The 3sɢ.ɴ-ᴘʀᴏx = hẽ हें /ˈɦɛ̃/ “it” probably derives from Sanskrit ɴᴏᴍ.sɢ.ɴ-ᴘʀᴏx <sup>!</sup>ēṣakam <sup>!</sup>एषकम् which would have given Prakrit <sup>!</sup>ēsagaṁ <sup>!</sup>एसगं which then would have become <sup>!</sup>ehayaṁ <sup>!</sup>एहयं ~ <sup>!</sup>ehaaṁ <sup>!</sup>एहअं in Apabhramsha, [<sup>!</sup>ehayaṁ → <sup>!</sup>haeṁ → hẽ]
